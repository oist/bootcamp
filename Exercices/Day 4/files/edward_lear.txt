Edward Lear
The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea
In a beautiful pea-green boat
They took some honey, and plenty of money
Wrapped up in a five-pound note
The Owl looked up to the stars above
And sang to a small guitar
"O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love
What a beautiful Pussy you are
You are
You are!
What a beautiful Pussy you are!"
